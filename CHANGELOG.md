# Release Notes for Blitz KeyCDN Purger

## 4.0.0 - 2024-03-19

> {warning} Blitz KeyCDN Purger is now a Craft CMS plugin rather than a PHP package, and as such it must be installed via Craft to be usable. You should manually remove `KeyCdnPurger` from the `cachePurgerTypes` config setting in your `config/blitz.php` file, if it exists, since the plugin now registers the purger automatically.
